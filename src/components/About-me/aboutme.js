                    <br></br><br></br>
                    I'm a thirty year-old man who loves to learn new stuff. In 2019, I decided to make a radical career shift. After working as a salesman for 7 years, I decided to become a web developer.
                    It took me some time, work, sweat and tears but I'm glad to say I've got my diploma.
                    <br></br>
                    The path="/" to becoming an accomplished developer is still long but you can count on my motivation and my thirst for learning.
                    <br></br>
                    You can learn more about my skills <NavLink className="here" to="/resume">here</NavLink>.
